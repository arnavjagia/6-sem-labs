    <h1>The road not taken</h1>
    Two roads diverged in a yellow <b>wood</b>,<br>
    And sorry I could not travel <b>both</b><br>
    And be one traveler, long I <b>stood</b><br>
    And looked down one as far as I <b>could</b><br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
    <br>
    Then took the other, as just as <b>fair</b>,<br>
    And having perhaps the better <b>claim</b>,<br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted <b>wear</b>;<br>
    Though as for that the passing <b>there</b><br>
    Had worn them really about the <b>same</b>,<br>
    <br>
    And both that morning equally <b>lay</b><br>
    In leaves no step had trodden <b>black.</b><br>
    Oh, I kept the first for another <b>day!</b><br>
    Yet knowing how way leads on to <b>way,</b><br>
    I doubted if I should ever come <b>back.</b><br>
    <br>
    I shall be telling this with a <b>sigh</b><br>
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and <b>I</b>-<br>
    I took the one less travelled <b>by</b>,<br>
    And that has made all the difference.<br>
